			<h1>Hacking the FBI’s Androids with 0day</h1>
			<p>After a number of episodes with no hacks, or any time in front of a screen, it’s good to see Elliot in his natural element again. This episode starts with our antihero scripting away to create a new exploit to hack the FBI. Though a lot seems to happen on Elliot’s screen, his monologue is what really gives you the technical details you need to understand the hack. Let’s unpack this scene.<br><br>

			First, what happens on his screen? This scene dynamically cuts between the many tasks and windows Elliot is working on, but only one of them has anything do with the FBI hack. In a wide shot, you see the four main windows he has up.<br>

			<video autobuffer autoloop loop controls class="videocss">
				<source src="./vid/mr_robot.webm">
				<source src="./vid/mr_robot.m4v">
				<object type="video/ogg" data="./vid/mr_robot.webm">
				<param name="src" value="./vid/mr_robot.ogv">
				<param name="autoplay" value="false">
				<param name="autoStart" value="0">
				</object>
			</video>

			The top windows pertain to the darkweb server migration project Elliot is supposed to be doing for Ray. In the top left window, he ran a command to install and update Tor, and in the top right Elliot unpacked the compressed backups of the “Marketplace” site (and its Tor configuration) onto a new server. In the bottom right window, he’s still chatting with Darlene on IRC. By the way, I didn’t spell it out in last week’s Rewind article, but her IRC handle, D0loresH4ze, is a reference to a character in the Lolita (which also explains her heart sunglasses). Anyway, the bottom right window is the only one relevant to the FBI hack. That’s where Elliot is writing a Ruby script.<br><br>

			Now the screens alone don’t tell you much about Elliot’s hack. For that, you need his narrative. I won’t cover it verbatim, but the first clue comes when Elliot mentions he’s using “Android zero days” to “own the FBI standard-issue smartphone.” This tells you two things. First, it confirms what you hopefully suspected after last episode. He’s targeting the FBI’s Android devices. Second, the reference to “zero days” conveys that Elliot has apparently found some unpatched vulnerabilities in Android. He can presumably leverage these vulnerabilities to gain control of the FBI’s Android devices. Though he uses flowery language to discuss the process, Elliot essentially tells us that he’s writing a script to exploit these zero-day Android flaws.<br>
